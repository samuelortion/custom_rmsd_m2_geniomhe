## Introduction

### Objective
- Develop a **coarse-grained RMSD (CG-RMSD)** metric for RNA structure evaluation.
- Compare CG-RMSD to existing structural metrics:
  - RMSD
  - MCQ
  - TM-Score

### Why is this important?
- RNA structure prediction metrics guide better modeling and understanding of RNA functionality.

## Dataset



### Data Overview
- **Native Structures**: RNA-Puzzles dataset
  - Total structures: 22 non-redundant `.pdb` files.
- **Predicted Structures**: Models from various RNA structure prediction tools.
- **Precomputed Metrics**:
  - RMSD
  - MCQ
  - TM-Score

---

## Methodology

### Workflow for Custom CG-RMSD
1. Load native and predicted RNA structures.
2. Align structures to minimize deviation.
3. Select specific atoms per nucleotide for coarse-grained calculation.
4. Compute and store CG-RMSD values.

## Results

### Computed CG-RMSD Values
- **Example Values**:
  - Structure `rp03` with `alphafold3` model: 16.307
  - Structure `rp14_free` with `trrosettarna` model: 5.511 
  - Structure `rp23` with `isrna` model: 12.966

### Correlation Analysis

| Correlation with | all    | P      | C5'    | O5'    | [P, O5', C5', C4', C3', C2', C1', O1',O3'] |
| :--------------- | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----------------------------------------- |
| RMSD             | 0.694  | 0.726  | 0.727  | 0.729  | 0.730                                      |
| MCQ              | 0.133  | 0.131  | 0.123  | 0.129  | 0.130                                      |
| TM-Score         | -0.386 | -0.414 | -0.415 | -0.416 | -0.415                                     |

## Challenges

### Key Challenges Encountered
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Missing data in `.pdb` files: the length of the predicted structures does not always match the native structures.
- **Metric Validation**:
  - Statistical validation of CG-RMSD results compared to standard metrics.



### Notes
- Some atom names does not correspond to standard nucleotides.

---

## Discussion

### Comparative Analysis
- **Strengths**:
  - Simplified representation using coarse-grained selection.
  - Faster computation compared to full-atomic metrics.
- **Limitations**:
  - Loss of atomic detail in coarse-grained calculations.
  - Possible insensitivity to minor structural variations.

## About the choice of a correlation metrics

- Spearman correlation does not require a linear correlation.
- Pearson is sensitive to outliers.

## Conclusion and Future Work

### Summary of Findings
- Custom CG-RMSD implemented and compared to RMSD, MCQ, and TM-Score.
- Correlation results: the correlation is higher with more atoms selected.

### Future Directions
- Apply CG-RMSD to more diverse RNA datasets.
- Refine atom selection criteria to improve accuracy.
- Explore automation of the metric within RNA modeling tools.
