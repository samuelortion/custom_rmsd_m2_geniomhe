## Slide 1: Introduction

### Objective
- Develop a **coarse-grained RMSD (CG-RMSD)** metric for RNA structure evaluation.
- Compare CG-RMSD to existing structural metrics:
  - RMSD
  - MCQ
  - TM-Score

### Why is this important?
- RNA structure prediction metrics guide better modeling and understanding of RNA functionality.

---

## Slide 2: Dataset

### Data Overview
- **Native Structures**: RNA-Puzzles dataset
  - Total structures: 22 non-redundant `.pdb` files.
- **Predicted Structures**: Models from various RNA structure prediction tools.
- **Precomputed Metrics**:
  - RMSD
  - MCQ
  - TM-Score

---

## Slide 3: Methodology

### Workflow for Custom CG-RMSD
1. Load native and predicted RNA structures.
2. Align structures to minimize deviation.
3. Select specific atoms per nucleotide for coarse-grained calculation.
4. Compute and store CG-RMSD values.
